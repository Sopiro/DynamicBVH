# Dynamic Bounding Volume Hierarchies
Dynamic BVH(Dynamic AABB tree) implementation in TypeScript.  

Dynamic BVH is one of the spatial partitioning data structures. You can accelerate a operation like volumetric querying and ray casting with BVH. The code is written for 2D, but can be easily extended to 3D or higher dimensions.
