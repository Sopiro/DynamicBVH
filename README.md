# Dynamic Bounding Volume Hierarchies
Dynamic BVH(Dynamic AABB tree) implemented in TypeScript.  

This algorithm is used for spatial partitioning which can accelerate a operation like object querying and ray casting.  
I used this algorithm for [my physics engine](https://github.com/Sopiro/Physics) to accelerate the broad phase collision detection process.  
This can be easily extended to 3D.
